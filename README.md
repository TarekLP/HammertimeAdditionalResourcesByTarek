Hammertime
======



---

Hammertime is an open-source Fork of Sledge which is an open-source Alternative to Valve's Hammer Editor for the Goldsource engine.
It is written in .NET and uses [Veldrid][2] for rendering, with DirectX 10.

Hammertime supports Goldsource mapping, and is constantly being updated to add more Features, some of these Features include:
- Prefab Support
- SMD Prop Making Support for 3D Models
- J.A.C.K Features
- Realtime Lighting (Not yet confirmed)
- (Additional Features WIP))

Here are also some good Community Editors if you need some:
- [TrenchBroom](https://github.com/kduske/TrenchBroom) (as of writing, TrenchBroom has some small Support for Half-Life, but is dependent on Community Contributions to expand the Support for Half Life, so its not complete right now.)
- Valve Hammer Editor (Found in the steam Library which you get when you own Half Life 1)
- [JACK](http://jack.hlfx.ru/en/download.html) (the free version, don't pay for it, since it isnt being updated by the developer.)

The Hammertime Editor is licensed under BSD-3.
